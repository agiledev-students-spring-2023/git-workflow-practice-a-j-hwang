# Some Thought
The article throws in some questions regarding AI generated contents and whether it can be 'creative' to the level of humans. To set standards to what may be considered as an 'art', it brings in concepts as being autonomous and having singularity. After showing various worries, she concludes that we can never be all-knowing and perfect as a machine, but at the same time a machine can't be us. She says that an AI is merely a tool for art, at least for now. However, instead of saying that it is impossible for AI art to be beautiful, I feel like the real question is: what if it is beautiful? What should we do when AI starts to win Pulitzer Prize? How should we evaluate the role of technology in the creation of art and journalism? It's about being ready, not about being scared.

Would an AI tool capable of winning the Pulitzer deserve it? If it is able to create beautiful things, what then is differentiating it's ability to create from a human's? -Biraj Chowdhury

## Comment from Chenyi Xu:
Although AI tools are now able to scrape all the information on the Internet and generate 
'art' pieces based on analysis of existing artworks, I still believe the unique personal 
experience of each human being is what distinguishes man-made art from 
AI-generated ones. Moreover, human artists can tell the story or emotion behind each 
piece they make because they are a reflection of their own lives. Meanwhile, AI 'artists' 
may lack the ability to articulate what they are trying to convey through their work.
